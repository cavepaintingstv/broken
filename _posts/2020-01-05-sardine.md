<p style="font-size:15px">I'm back.<br><br>

As some of you may know, I moved to France in early 2019 to work as an animator on the upcoming animated show  <i>Sardine de l'Espace</i>. Well, my work there is now complete! We wrapped up in late December, and I have returned to the UK to focus on creating my own independent shorts for the time being. Despite a few ups and downs (including being burgled <i><b>twice</b></i>), I had a lot of fun in France and made many wonderful, creative friends whom I hold dear to my heart.
<br><br>
Thanks for bearing with me while I get settled and prepared to release more animated content for you all. A man's gotta eat—and live—to some extent.
